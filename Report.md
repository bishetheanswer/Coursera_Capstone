# Traffic Collision Severity

## Introduction

We want to create a model to predict the severity of a Traffic Collision given the collision context as a group of features. This could be of interest to the Health Care System
since it would allow it to assign the right amount of resources to each accident depending on the severity predicted. 

## Data

The data that will be used for this task is obtained from the Seattle Government more specifically from **SDOT Traffic Management Division**. This data set contains very useful information as the
amount of vehicles involved in the collision, the number of people, the weather or the speeding. Using the information provided by the data set we will be able to create a model that predicts 
the severity of a Traffic Collision.
