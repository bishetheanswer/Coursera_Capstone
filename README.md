Seattle Collision Severity Classifier
======================
In this repository you will find the **Notebook**, the **Report** and the **Presentation** of the project.
* Performed data cleaning and feature selection.
* Analyzed the evolution of the amount of collisions through the years.
* Analyzed how the collisions distribute through the day and how being influenced by alcohol/ drugs affects to collisions.
* Created a map using Folium to visualize the locations of the collisions _(in the notebook found in this repository the map code is commented due to storage problems, but the full execution of the notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bishetheanswer/seattle-collision-severity-classifier) in Kaggle)_.
* Built Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression models.
